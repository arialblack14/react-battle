## Reactjs Program

This is a simple app in order to better understand how React works.

In order to run the app, just type the following:

- `npm i` to install needed modules
- `npm run production` for production mode
- `npm run start` to run a local dev server.

> Hint:  I used Webpack and Babel for this.
